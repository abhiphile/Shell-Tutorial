In Bash, the `>` symbol is used for output redirection. It allows you to redirect the output of a command to a file instead of displaying it on the terminal. Here’s how to use it:

### Basic Syntax
```bash
command > filename
```

### How It Works
- **Overwrite a file**: If the file already exists, using `>` will overwrite its contents.
- **Create a new file**: If the file does not exist, it will create a new one.

### Examples

1. **Redirect output to a file**:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, World!" > output.txt
   ```
   This command writes "Hello, World!" to `output.txt`. If `output.txt` already exists, it will be overwritten.

2. **Redirect output of a command**:
   ```bash
   ls -l > directory_list.txt
   ```
   This lists the contents of the current directory in long format and saves it to `directory_list.txt`.

3. **Append to a file**: If you want to add to the contents of a file instead of overwriting it, use `>>`:
   ```bash
   echo "Another line" >> output.txt
   ```
   This adds "Another line" to the end of `output.txt`.

4. **Redirect error output**: You can also redirect error messages using `2>`:
   ```bash
   command_that_might_fail 2> error_log.txt
   ```
   This will save any error messages from the command to `error_log.txt`.

### Conclusion
Using `>` and `>>` for output redirection is a fundamental part of working with Bash. It’s helpful for logging output, saving results, and managing files. If you have more specific scenarios in mind, let me know!
